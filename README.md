# sony-tv-kdl32v5500-sound
Sony TV (32 inch, 2009) with sound issues that need fixing.

Model number: KDL32V5500

Donor: KDL46V5500

## Symptoms
Sound level (volume or tone, I'm not sure which) fluctuates at (say) 0.5 Hz sometimes, making it difficult to hear speech.

I first noticed this on HDMI input from Virgin TV box.
